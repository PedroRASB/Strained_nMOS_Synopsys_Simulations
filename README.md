# Strained_nMOS_Synopsys_Simulations
Simulations of nMOS transistors with strained silicon in their gates. Created with the software Synopsys.
The file TransistorProcessing1_5GPa.cmd creates a nMOS transistor with 1.5GPa stress in the channel. The files SimulationIdVgs.cmd and SimulationIdVds.cmd simulate it (making Id Vs Vgs and Id Vs Vds curves). sdevice.par is used by imulationIdVgs.cmd and SimulationIdVds.cmd.
